# Building a Killer Workspace Experience with UI Builder

## Goal

In this lab you will learn how to use UI Builder to build and configure a workspace for a custom application. You will start with a prebuilt application to manage a company's fleet of vehicles.

You will use UI Builder to open a starter workspace experience created from App Engine Studio to build out the fulfiller workspace experience to make it easier to interact with the application and make your fulfillers more productive. This lab will touch on a number of different parts of UI Builder while you create the custom experience including but not limited to:

* Creating lists
* Creating new pages
* Page parameters
* Data resources
* Client state parameters
* Client scripts
* Configuring components
* Using the repeater component
* Updating ServiceNow records from the experience
* Working with the Standard Record Page template

## Lab Objective

The primary objective of this lab is to expose you to the different parts of configuring and customizing a workspace. A very basic fleet vehicle management workspace exists in your instance and you will configure it similarly to how you would configure one of ServiceNow's default workspaces.

## (Optional) Pre-flight check

If you're doing this lab during CreatorCon, you'll be working on an instance on NowLearning loaded with the FLeet Vehicle Management application. If you're following along with this lab guide on a Personal Developer Instance (PDI), please follow the instructions in the Appendix at the end of this lab guide to learn how to pull in the Fleet Vehicle Management application.

# Exercise 1 - Basic Workspace Configuration

## Open the app

1. In the top menu in your instance, click **All**, type *App Engine* into the filter, and click **App Engine Studio** to launch *App Engine Studio*, or *AES* as we'll call it moving forward.

  The app currently consists of the following primary tables:

     * Vehicle
     * Maintenance requests
     * Maintenance tasks
     * Parts

1. Open UI Builder by clicking on the **Fleet Vehicle Management** workspace under *Experiences*.
